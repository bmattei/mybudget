*  1  Top Menu has too many entries and some of the buttons overlap

  - I think the easiest solution for now is to add a flag to the accounts
    that specifies if the account should appear in the menu.
  - If I do this I need to add show buttons to the account index page.
  FIXED - added in_menu field to account.
        added show to account view page.
	changed _top_menu to only show accounts that have in_menu set.
  NEEDS TEST

*  2 Sort indicator is sometimes under text.

*  3  The filters section of the accounts show page has date range on one line
  and other ranges on two

  FIXED - all ranges now on one line.
  NEEDS TEST but not sure how to do it.

*  4 The entrydate on show page wraps.

* 5 Entries take too long to render on account show page.
 - I need to speed this up and or paginate.
 - FIXED - FOR NOW I FILTER BY START DATE IF NOT FILTERS ARE PASSED.
 - NEEDS TEST

 * 6 NEED an ETL To READ DOWNLOADED DISCOVER Transactions

 * 7 NEED an ETL to READ DONLOADED DCU Transaction

 * 8 ON ACCOUNT SHOW PAGE IF YOU BRING UP a New or Edit Menu you lose the filters
   FIXED THIS I used the request.referrer to specify the link associated with the cancel button
         I pass the referrer as a hidden field in the form and use it in create and update to the new or edit
         to set the redirect path.
