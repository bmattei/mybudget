* 1 - Top Menu has too many entries and some of the buttons overlap.
  - I think the easiest solution for now is to add a flag to the accounts
    that specifies if the account should appear in the menu.
  - If I do this I need to add show buttons to the account index page.
  MOD - added in_menu field to account.
        added show to account view page.
	changed _top_menu to only show accounts that have in_menu set.


* Sort indicator is sometimes under text.

* The filters section of the accounts show page has date range on one line
  and other ranges on two.

* The entrydate on show page wraps.

* Entries take too long to render on account show page.
 - I need to speed this up and or paginate.
